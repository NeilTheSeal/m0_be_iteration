# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
When you need to iterate over every element in an array, you use `each`. For example, if you have a list of names and you want to check how many people in that list are named Frank, you could use the `each` method. There are millions of uses for iteration. You could use `each` to add up all the numbers in an array, or to make a new array where certain elements in the array are changed. The possibilities are endless.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
I need to practice writing the first line of an `each` iteration, i.e. `array.each do |elt|`. Everything after that I am pretty confident about.

- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this assignment?
It helped to look up the documentation for `each`, which is here https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.2/Array.html#method-i-each. This showed me alternative syntax for writing `each` statements.
